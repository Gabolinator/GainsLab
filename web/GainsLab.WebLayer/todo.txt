TODO
====
- Create list/detail pages for each training entity (view, edit, delete, add).
- Flesh out dedicated components/forms backing those pages.
- Hook pages/components into existing services to load/save entities.
- Add navigation menu entries pointing to each new entity page.
- Add authentication UX (login/logout, token refresh) and User management pages that integrate with the backend services.
- Add component/unit tests (e.g., bUnit/test host) for the new CRUD/auth flows.
