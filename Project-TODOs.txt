GainsLab.Domain (backend/GainsLab.Domain, README.md + todo.txt)
1. Implement full aggregates for Exercise, ExerciseBlock, Workout, Program, and any remaining training artifacts so the domain continues to provide canonical immutable models, identifiers, and descriptors (Entities/, CoreEnums, Entities/Identifier, builder interfaces).
2. Introduce/extend value objects, relationship modeling, and builders (CreationInfo, Descriptor attachments, identifier lists) so downstream layers can persist and hydrate these training entities consistently.
3. Update EntityType/DataAuthority enums, seed resolver hooks, and domain interfaces so the new entities participate in the same persistence-agnostic workflows described in the README.
4. Design robust User aggregates (account info, roles, credentials metadata) under `Entities/User` so identity data matches the same immutable/value-object standards.

GainsLab.Application (backend/GainsLab.Application, README.md + todo.txt)
5. Create CRUD + sync DTO suites for Exercise, ExerciseBlock, Workout, and Program under DTOs/, mirroring the patterns documented in the README (records, request/response models, sync DTOs).
6. Add domain mappers (DomainMappers/<Entity>Mapper.cs) and wire them through EntityDomainMapper so DTOs ↔ aggregates translation is covered.
7. Expose repositories/providers/gateways/services for the new training entities (Interfaces/…) and ensure Result/APIResult flows back controllers as described in the README.
8. Introduce user DTOs, mappers, gateways, and application services handling account management and authentication-facing workflows.
9. Extend factories/seeders where necessary so seeding/bootstrap stories remain aligned with the new training and user entities.

GainsLab.Infrastructure (backend/GainsLab.Infrastructure, README.md + todo.txt)
10. Extend GainLabPgDBContext/GainLabSQLDBContext with DbSets/configuration/migrations for each training entity and ensure SeedResolver/DataRepository handler maps know about them.
11. Implement repositories, DB handlers, sync services, caches, registries, and HTTP gateway implementations covering Exercise, ExerciseBlock, Workout, and Program as outlined in the README (SyncService/, DB/, Caching/, Api/).
12. Add EF models, repositories, sync/auth plumbing, and supporting services for User accounts/roles (password hashing, token storage, etc.).
13. Register the new services/providers in DI, update `HttpDataProvider`/`IApiClientRegistry`, and ensure outbox/sync pipelines handle the new DTOs (training + user) end to end.

GainsLab.Api (backend/GainsLab.Api, README.md + todo.txt)
14. Add ASP.NET controllers for each training entity (CRUD + /sync endpoints) that leverage the application services, DTOs, and APIResultValidation helpers documented in the README.
15. Introduce authentication/authorization (identity provider, JWT/bearer config, policies) plus User management controllers.
16. Wire routes/Swagger descriptions, validation, and DI registrations so the controllers expose the same shape as existing descriptor/equipment endpoints while reflecting auth requirements.

GainsLab.WebLayer (web/GainsLab.WebLayer, README.md + todo.txt)
17. Build Razor pages/components for listing, viewing, creating, editing, and deleting each training entity, following the layout/component patterns in Components/ and Model/.
18. Hook the pages into the registered gateways/providers, ensure toast/confirmation UX handles the new flows, and add nav menu entries so the entities are discoverable from the editor shell.
19. Implement authentication UX (login/logout, token refresh) and user management pages tied into the backend identity services.

Testing & Quality
20. Stand up unit test projects (Domain/Application/Infrastructure/API/WebLayer) covering aggregates, DTO mappers, repositories, services, controllers, and UI logic; ensure CI runs them so new training/user/auth code is validated continuously.
