TODO
====
- Implement gateway/service surfaces for each missing training entity to orchestrate API calls.
- Ensure SyncService variants push/pull entity data and reconcile conflicts.
- Extend DbContext with tables/sets for the new entities and add migrations as needed.
- Introduce repositories encapsulating persistence logic for each entity.
- Register services, repositories, and caches in the DI registry for discovery.
- Provide caching strategies plus API endpoints/adapters so infrastructure fully supports the new entities.
- Add EF models/repositories/sync + auth plumbing for User accounts/roles plus supporting services (password hashing, tokens, etc.).
- Add unit tests/integration tests for repositories, sync services, auth plumbing, and caching behaviors.
