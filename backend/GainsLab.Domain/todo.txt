- Flesh out Exercise entity (value objects, descriptors, relationships).
- Model ExerciseBlock entity (grouping, sequencing, metadata).
- Build Workout entity tying blocks, scheduling, tracking fields.
- Expand Program entity aggregating workouts and progression rules.
- Audit remaining training entities to ensure every training artifact has a concrete domain entity.
- Design rich User aggregates (account info, roles, auth metadata) and align with existing `Entities/User` folder patterns.
- Add unit tests covering the new training/user aggregates, value objects, and builders.
