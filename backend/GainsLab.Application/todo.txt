TODO
====
- Define CRUD DTOs for each missing training entity.
- Implement/extend mappers translating between DTOs and domain models.
- Ensure application services expose operations backing the API controllers.
- Introduce user DTOs/mappers/services (accounts, roles, auth profiles) so higher layers can manage identities.
- Add unit tests for DTOs, mappers, and services covering both training and user flows.
