TODO
====
- Add controllers (and supporting DTO/model bindings) for each new training entity.
- Wire routes, validation, and swagger descriptions for the new endpoints.
- Call into application/infrastructure services so controllers expose full CRUD/sync capabilities.
- Introduce authentication/authorization (identity provider, JWT/bearer, policies) and expose User management controllers.
- Add unit/integration tests for controllers and auth policies/handlers.
